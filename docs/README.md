## Flipper Hero Game

Flipper Hero is a typing game that challenges you to improve your typing skills by inputting codes. Track your high score and challenge yourself to beat it with each attempt.
Flpper Hero has been updated to more closely resemble its inspiration, Stratagem Hero from Helldivers 2.
A pause menu has been added with a few settings. It can be accessed by pressing the "BACK" button. Settings can be saved by pressing the "OK" button in the settings menu.
The "New Strgms:" option in the settings menu enables the inclusion of stratagems not in Stratagem Hero. This includes stratagems from warbonds, and mission-specific stratagems.
